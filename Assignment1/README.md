# CMPS 367: Object Oriented Language C++ Spring 2024 - Assignment 1

Welcome to Assignment 1 for CMPS 367, Spring 2024. This repository contains a series of small C++ projects aimed at practicing mathematical operations using various C++ features. Each project is crafted to enhance understanding of different mathematical and programming concepts ranging from basic arithmetic operations to complex functions.

## Deliverables

This repository includes:
- Individual C++ source files for each problem.
- Extensive comments within the C++ source code to explain the functionality and logic.
- This `README.md` file providing an overview, features, and execution instructions.
- Output examples for each application to demonstrate expected results.

## Overview

The applications developed as part of this assignment serve educational purposes, primarily aimed at students new to programming in C++. They cover a range of basic to advanced mathematical functions to demonstrate the application of C++ programming concepts in solving real-world mathematical problems.

### Intended Audience

These applications are designed for beginner to intermediate programming students who are enrolled in CMPS 367. They help bridge the gap between theoretical mathematical concepts and practical programming applications.

## Features

- **Basic Calculator**: Performs addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
- **BMI Calculator**: Calculates the Body Mass Index based on user height and weight.
- **Multiplication Table Generator**: Produces a multiplication table for specified number ranges.
- **Math Calculator**: Handles complex mathematical operations including trigonometric and logarithmic functions using the `<cmath>` library.

## How to Run the Applications

Each application can be compiled and run using a C++ compiler. Here are the general steps to compile and execute the programs:

1. **Compilation**:
   Navigate to the directory containing the project file and compile using `g++`:
   ```bash
   g++ -o application_name main.cpp

### Additional Tips:
- Ensure each C++ file is clearly commented to explain the code effectively, especially around complex logic.
- You might want to include actual output examples or screenshots in your repository if that helps illustrate the results more effectively.
- Adjust the paths and file names as per your actual directory structure and naming conventions.
