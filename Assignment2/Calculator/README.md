# Nick's Calculator

## Overview
Nick's Calculator is a C++ console application developed for the CMPS 368 - Object-Oriented Programming course, Spring 2024. It provides a simple interface for performing basic arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. The calculator is designed to help students understand the implementation of basic arithmetic operations in C++ and handle edge cases like division by zero.

## Features
- **Basic Arithmetic Operations**: Supports addition (`+`), subtraction (`-`), multiplication (`*`), and division (`/`).
- **Error Handling**: Provides feedback for division by zero and unsupported operations.
- **Interactive Session**: Allows users to perform multiple calculations in a session without restarting the application.
- **Input Validation**: Checks for invalid inputs and prompts users to re-enter the correct data.

## How to Run
To run Nick's Calculator, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/NickDee909/CMPS367-OOP.git

./Calculator

#Usage example
Enter first number, operator, and second number (e.g., 1 + 1): 12 / 4
Result: 3
Do you want to perform another calculation? (y/n): y

Enter first number, operator, and second number (e.g., 1 + 1): 9 * 3
Result: 27
Do you want to perform another calculation? (y/n): n

Thank you for using the calculator.
