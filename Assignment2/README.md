# Assignment 2: Struct Integration in C++

## Overview
Assignment 2 is designed for CMPS 368 - Object-Oriented Programming, Spring 2024. This assignment focuses on enhancing the understanding and application of structures (`structs`) in C++. Students are required to refactor their previous assignment's solutions by integrating `structs` to manage variables more effectively. This exercise aims to reinforce the concepts of data encapsulation and structuring in C++ programming.

## Objectives
- **Struct Practice**: Convert all variables from previous assignment solutions into structured formats.
- **Enhance Code Organization**: Improve code readability and maintainability by grouping related data within structs.
- **Understand Object Access**: Gain deeper insights into object-oriented access and modification of data through structured instances.

## Problems and Points
This assignment consists of five problems, each a continuation of the problems from Assignment 1. Each problem involves refactoring existing code to use structs instead of loose variable declarations. The total points for this assignment are 100, distributed equally among the problems.

### Problem Breakdown
1. **Problem 1-5 (From Assignment 1)**: 
   - Convert all standalone variables and arrays into structs.
   - Initialize and manipulate data through struct instances.
   - Ensure that the entire program flow is adapted to reflect the new struct-based data handling.

## Due Date
- **Due on April 10**

## Submission Guidelines
- Create a zip file containing all your C++ project files. Each problem should be clearly labeled and organized.
- Upload the zip file to the designated GitHub repository.
- Ensure that each file includes comments explaining the functionality and any changes made from the original Assignment 1 solutions.

## How to Run
Given the structural changes to the original assignments, the running instructions remain similar, with emphasis on how structs are initialized and used within the program. For example:

```bash
g++ problem1.cpp -o Problem1
./Problem1
